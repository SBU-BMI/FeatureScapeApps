A number of web applications were developed to assess the feasibility of the featurescape architecture. The key design criteria is the **a)** minimization of compute cycles per usage by balancing server and client side components; **b)** a ***statistical zooming engine*** (client side) that uses a uniformly random seed index (server-side) to resolve multivariate feature spaces, and **c)** maximize the use of ***public Big Data***, such as [NCI's TCGA](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/tumor/), by client-side caching in the modern web browser NoSQL engine ([indexedDB](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/)). 

Although the examples below demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by delivering real-time navigation of large feature spaces, the more valuable deliverables are the public APIs  articulated by a HTTP REST API. These APIs are typically reproduced at the top of the user interface. 

### 1. Navigating 1.3 billion measures across 48 dimensions

### 2. Traversing molecular, morphological and survival data. 
Demo for 522 patients, each documented for 400+ parameters, live at sbu-bmi.github.io/featurescape/fig4.html.

#### Mugshots of the "bad guys"... the bad nuclei, that is. Wanted: for robbery (of good health!)

<BR>
**USAGE:**

[NUCLEI MUGSHOT DEMO PAGE](http://sbu-bmi.github.io/FeatureScapeApps/NucleiMugshot/)

1. Hover over the smaller patch containing a nucleus to view it larger.
2. The larger patch underneath shows the nucleus in context.
3. Click on either patch to go to the location in caMicroscope.
